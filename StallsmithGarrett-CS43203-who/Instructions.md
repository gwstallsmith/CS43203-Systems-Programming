The provided comment is part of a C program (`who4.txt`) and provides instructions or objectives for modifying and enhancing the functionality of the program:
---

1. **Identity crisis**: This phrase implies that there is ambiguity or confusion regarding the usage of the 'who' command. It mentions that both 'who am i' and 'whoami' are acceptable usages according to the manual page of the 'who' command.

2. **Modify who2.c**: It refers to modifying an existing C file named 'who2.c'. Presumably, 'who2.c' is a program that performs some functionality related to the 'who' command.

3. **Support the 'who am i' usage**: The instruction asks to modify the program so that it supports the usage 'who am i'. This means that when the program is executed with the argument 'am i', it should produce output similar to the 'who' command.

4. **Experiment with the 'whom' command**: It suggests experimenting with another command called 'whom' and reading its manual (using 'man whom'). This is to understand the differences between 'whom' and 'who am i' commands.

5. **Write a program like 'whoami'**: Finally, it requests writing a program that functions similarly to the 'whoami' command. 'whoami' is a command in Unix-like operating systems that prints the effective user ID of the current user.

In summary, the comment outlines tasks related to modifying an existing C program, understanding differences between various Unix commands ('who', 'whoami', 'whom'), and creating a program with functionality similar to 'whoami'.
